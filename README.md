# 🎧Spotify-Dashboard-Project

Welcome to the **Spotify Analysis Project** repository 🚀 

This project presents an in-depth analysis of music popularity trends, artist performance, and song characteristics using Spotify data, visualized through an interactive dashboard. This dashboard serves as a case study in Data Analysis and Business Intelligence (BI).

**Project Type**: End-to-End Data Analytics & Business Intelligence.

**Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel (for Data Source & Cleaning), and Data Visualization Tool Power BI for reporting.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a streamlined Business Intelligence (BI) workflow, transforming raw music data into actionable market insights:
1. **Data Source (Excel)** → Spotify Top Hits dataset containing track, artist, and popularity metrics, initially processed and cleaned in Excel.
2. **Data Transformation** → Data imported directly from the Excel file into the visualization tool.
3. **KPI Calculation (DAX/Calculated Fields)** → Aggregation and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) calculations, such as Total Popularity and Average Position, are performed within the visualization tool's modeling layer.
4. **Dashboard (Visualization Tool)** → Interactive reports and visual insights into music trends.

## 🎯  Business Requirement
Spotify stakeholders (music analysts, playlist managers, and marketing teams) need a **consolidated dashboard** to monitor song and artist performance across different dimensions.
Based on the screens provided, the business requires:

🏠 Overview Page
- Track KPIs like **Total Songs, Distinct Artists, Average Popularity, Avg Duration.**
- Compare **Explicit vs Non-Explicit Songs** and see their share.
- Analyze **Songs by Album Type** (single, album, compilation).
- View **Distinct Songs and Avg Popularity by Year.**
- Trend analysis of **Avg Popularity & Distinct Songs by Month.**
- Highlight **Top Songs & Top Artists by Popularity.**

👤  Artist Page
- Show **Top Artists by Popularity.**
- Compare **Tracks per Album and Songs by Artist.**
- Provide drill-down to artist-level data **artist name, distinct song, position 1 hits per artist ,avg popularity per artist, avg position, avg duration per year.**
- Support identifying artists with consistent hits and #1 positions.

🎶 Songs Page
- Rank **Top Songs by Popularity.**
- Show Tracks per Song (Album/Single distribution).
- Compare **Songs by Song Count.**
- Provide detailed table with **song name, release date, avg popularity, position, avg duration per minutes.**

## 📌 Problem Statement
Currently, Spotify’s raw “Top 50” dataset is limited to lists and rankings, making it difficult for stakeholders to see patterns and take insights quickly.
From the screens, the key problems solved are:

- **No clear KPI monitoring** → Dashboard provides quick summary of total songs, artists, popularity, duration, etc.
- **Lack of explicit vs non-explicit analysis** → Users can compare how explicit songs perform vs non-explicit.
- **Difficulty in tracking song/album distribution** → Visuals show breakdown by album type and release year.
- **Trend visibility missing** → Popularity and distinct songs trends are shown over time (monthly & yearly).
- **Artist vs Song level insights not connected** → Drill-down pages for Artists and Songs connect overview insights to detailed records.
- **Decision-making gaps** → Marketing and curation teams can now identify which artists/songs to promote, trends to follow, and which content resonates with audiences.
